## Comments

After reading the feedback of Cpnt262-a2,I fixed my CSS to make gallery be centred on the page. It seems easy for me to complete this assignment if I followed the steps provided from Tony. First,install and load express, then use the express.static() method to serve a static website and deploy it to Heroku. The biggest challenge is this kind of new knowledge need to practise more to realize and learn. I need to practise in my daily coding to ensure that I can understand more about these steps.

Thank you for teaching!
